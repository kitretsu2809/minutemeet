PS:The core idea is to create a service that helps groups of people decide on a meeting place, taking into account factors like:
Location: Where are the group members currently located?
Travel Time & Distance: Optimize for the meeting spot that minimizes the overall travel time or distance for the entire group.
Preferences: What types of places do the group members like? (e.g., restaurants, cafes, parks)
Specific Choices: If group members have specific places in mind, the service should be able to factor those into the decision-making process.
Technical Approach
Mapping & Geolocation:
need to integrate with a mapping service (e.g., Google Maps, Mapbox) to handle:
Geocoding: Converting addresses to geographic coordinates
Reverse Geocoding: Converting coordinates to addresses
Calculating distances and travel times between points
Displaying maps and locations to users
User Interface:
A web or mobile app where users can:
Enter their location or have it automatically detected
Invite other group members to join the decision-making process
Specify their preferences (types of places, specific locations)
View suggested meeting spots on a map
Vote or indicate their preference for the suggested spots
Finalize the meeting spot
Backend & Algorithms:
need a backend service to:
Store user data, preferences, and group information
Implement algorithms to:
Calculate the optimal meeting spot based on location, travel time/distance, and preferences
Handle voting and preference aggregation
Provide suggestions for places based on user preferences and location
Data & APIs:
want to integrate with APIs or databases that provide information about places, such as:
Restaurant reviews and ratings
More focusing on distance only as parameter
Opening hours
Menus
Other relevant information that can help users make a decision
Development Suggestions:
Start Simple: Begin with a basic implementation that focuses on location and travel time optimization. (Stating with developing decision model for given data)
Iterate & Add Features: Gradually add features like preference handling, specific location suggestions, and data integration.
User Experience: Make the app intuitive and easy to use, especisss’;l’
lally for group interactions.
Consider Privacy: Be mindful of user data and location privacy.
Additional Considerations:
Real-time Updates: If users are on the move, consider real-time location updates to provide more accurate suggestions.
Traffic & Transit: Factor in traffic conditions and public transit options for more realistic travel time estimates.(Advance Feature)
Accessibility: Take into account accessibility needs of group members when suggesting places.(If someone is physically disabled then look for wheelchair accessible place) (Add On Feature)
Tech Stack:
	App (Flutter(Dart))
	Backend (Django As it will be easy to add functionalities with data analysis using python)
database:MongoDB
